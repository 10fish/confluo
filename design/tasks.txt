-Make an implementation plan and post it to the issue
-Type manager class
-Register method takes in arguments operators, update vectors
-Ask for a type name as a field for primitive and new types
-Use atomic fetch and add when registering types (so when you try to add
new types at the same time the counter is updated correctly)
-Create a regex vector for primitive and user defined types like ip
addresses that parses data in the string to add a type
